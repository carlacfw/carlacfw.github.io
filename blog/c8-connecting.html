    <h5>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h5>
    <p>Yes. I believe that trust is something that you achieve and once you have it, you have to value it, both sides.</p>
    <h5>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h5>
    <p>Empathic listening is something that looks like I'm skilled I just did not called like that. But I defintely have an easy time understanding people's feelings during a conversation.</p>
    <h5> How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h5>
    <p>It is nice. I'm a positive person, so I'm always trying to make myself understand even very difficult situations or feelings as a learning and turn it into something good.</p>
