      <h2>Introducing JavaScript</h2>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="content">
    <ul>
      <li> How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</li>
      <p>Web pages are built with three differents languages, HTM (markup), CSS (style) and JavaScript. JavaScript is a programming language which makes the page dinamic, everything that is interactive is made with JavaScript. You can biuld a web page using
        only HTML and CSS, but if you want to add some animate image, as an advertisement for example, you will need some JS to make it work. The image below, is an exemple to how using these three languages, each one is linked to another.</p>

      <div class="borda">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="twelve columns" style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="../images/cake.png" alt="cake" style="width:250px;height:200px;"></div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <li>Control flow and loops, what are they?</li>
      <p>Control flow is used to make decisions into the JS, we use the <em>if/else statements</em> to control this decisions. A daily example of control flow is <em>if it is sunny I won't wear my rain coat. But (else) if it is rainy I need to wear my rain coat. </em>So
        we can understunding it as decisions made by consequences.</p>
      <p>Loops is when the programmer wants to do something for a fixed number of times, so it will be writing to do the same over and over again, no need to be written every time. Comparing with an alarm, you can set it to go off Monday-Friday at 6:30AM,
        then it will work and you won't need to set the alarm every single day. This is how a loop works too.</p>
      <li>The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</li>
      <p>Arrays are written inside brackets and its index, which is a numerical string, is based in zero which means that de data stored in it beggins at zero. Objects are something else and contains a collections of properties and we can add or remove this
        properties as we want, opposite the arrays.</p>
      <p>So the difference between both to acces their data, is that the arrays can only be accessed by brackets while the objects can be accessed in two ways, using dot <em>objectName.propertyName</em> or brackets <em>objectName["propertyName"]</em>.</p>
      <li>What functions are and why they are useful.</li>
      <p>Function is a block of code made to execute a particular task. It can be used in many times and also no need to write a code over again. All you need to do is call the function and execute the function you want. For exemple <b>function myFunction(p1, p2) {
    return p1 * p2;
} </b> Where function is a keyword to call itself.</p>
