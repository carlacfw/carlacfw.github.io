    <h1>Responsive Web Site, Design, Framework, Wireframe...What are they? </h1>
    <h2>Explaining to a non-technical person...</h2>

  </div>
  <div class="content">

    <ul>
      <li>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important?</li>

      <p>A responsive page is a page which the size changes to fit in any screen size device you are accessing it.</p>


      <li>What mobile first design is, and why it's important?</li>

      <p>The mobile design is the layout of a web page made to be seen on the screen of your mobile phone. It's been now the first option of design to create a web page because most of the users access a web page via mobile.</p>

      <li>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons?</li>

      <p>Frameworks are a common structure to build a web site or a programme, but let's talk about web site. You can use a framework to make differents web pages, we can try to compare with a CV template, you have this template but you can build your CV
        in different ways acording to the job application you are working in and so the Frameworks. There are lots of Frameworks you can use, it is your choice. And also is your choice to use a Framework or not, because you don't have to. Some advantages
        of using it are time, you same your time to build a web page with a good structure and you can easily access it in any browser. And one of the disadvantages is the fact that you won't learn how to do it by yourself and it is important you to know
        how to build it, like make pancakes, you can by those powder pancakes and just add some water and it will be ready to cook, BUT, if one day you can't get this powder for any reason but you really want you pancakes, you know how to prepare it using
        eggs and everything? See? It is important to know, even if you have easier ways. </p>

      <li>What a wireframe is and why we use it?</li>

      <p>A wireframe is like a draw of the web page, where we are going to place any element of our page. We use it to planning the layout of the web page before built it.</p>

      <div class="borda">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="six columns" style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="../images/image1.JPG" alt="wireframe" style="width:300px;height:250px;"></div>
          <div class="six columns" style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="../images/image2.JPG" alt="wireframe" style="width:300px;height:250px;"></div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>Those were my wireframes, as you can see, my web site doesn't look like the draw, because when I was building it I found another beatiful ways to make it.</p>
