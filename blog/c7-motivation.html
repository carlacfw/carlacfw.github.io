        <h5>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h5>
        <p>There's no secret that whatever you want to achieve you want to have happiness doing it, but people have different levels of happiness, we just need to follow our feelings to get it. For me is passion what makes me happy, when I do something that
          I have passion for, the time flies and I feel happy and relieved.</p>
        <h5> From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise:</h5>
        <h5> What are your core values? What do you stand for?</h5>
        <p>I'm honesty, dedicate - Everything I do, I do with all my best. And respect, you respect to be respected.</p>
        <h5>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h5>
        <p>Resilience is a gift from life, we always look for success but we forget to be prepered for failure and it is a 50-50 % for both. It's important that we have resilience to handle both, it's all about knowing ourseves deep inside and training our
          mind to handle even good situations and also the failure, which is always a bit hard to accept.</p>
