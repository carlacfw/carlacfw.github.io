    <h3>When I got blocked in a simple problem</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I can say that I got blocked many times by one simple problem... I believe that when programmers are writing their code, they have so much to pay attention that they forget to pay attention in the tiny details. So me, as a beginner, for sure I did
      it and I'm doing it again.</p>
    <p>I can tell one recent event that it happened. While applying the <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a>into my CSS file I've read so much about where put the links, how to style it and etc, then I put the links on the rigth place and I styled
      it, my Index page (Home web page) was looking great as I wanted, but when I clicked to se my posts it was weird, but it was running then I was glad, it took me a few days to realize that only my Index page was running the Skeleton and I started
      thinking "what am I doing wrong??" I checked my css file, checked if the div classes were well named and all was looking right, so why wasn't working? There was something wrong.</p>
    <p>We have lots of "problem solving" options like, googling, reading error messages, trying different ways to code, etc. And the most difficult asking for help, for someone who knows about it or for our coaches, but personally is difficult for me, because
      I wnat to do all by myself, I don't want to ask people for help, but it is needed and we/I have to accept it.</p>
    <p>Finally, as I wasn't able to find the error, I asked for help and then my helper looked my code and in only seconds found the error. I should have added those Skeleton links in every html file and I only did into my Index html file. So that was it,
      I just added the links and my web page was looking so beautiful, I was so glad that I could sleep better that night lol!

        <h3>Arrays</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>An array is a data structure that contains a group of elements.</p>
        <p>The functions .map() .filter() .reduce() running using a function as a parameter through objects of an array</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns">
          The <b><em>.filter()</em></b> is for filter the objects of an array, selecting only the ones that you want. As an exemple, imagine that you have an array like this [1,2,3,4,5,6] and you want to select only the numbers that can be divided by
          2, using the .filter() function you can get that.
        </div>

        <div class="six columns">
          The <b><em>.map()</em></b> is for transforming the objects of an array from one type to another type. If I have an array with number, using the .map() function it can turn into text.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="twelve columns">
          The <b><em>.reduce()</em></b> is for converting an array in only one value. For exemple, one array with numbers, using the .reduce() function can sum those number to have the result. Reducing the array in one object.
