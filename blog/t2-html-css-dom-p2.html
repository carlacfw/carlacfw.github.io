      <br>
      <li>What is a grid design?</li>
      <br>It's a structure used to align the elements into the grids. It makes you have a layout clean and well organised.<br>
      <br>
      <li>What is all the hype about responsive web page?</li>
      <br>We use lots of different screen sizes and a web page have to correspond to these screens on different sizes, Then having a responsive web page is important to people access it in whatever device screen size they want and it will work just fine.<br>
      <br>
      <li>What is semantic structure?</li>
      <br>Semantic structure is organising your code writing using the right tags on the right code writing.<br>
      <br>
      <li>Points that I found interesting and want to reflect on?</li>
      <br>Well, is everything new for me, so I find everything interesting and I feel curious to get more knowledge in everything possible. But I really liked to knew about the grid design, it looks so good to working on and I love make things organised.
      I'm excited to learn how to do it ASAP!
