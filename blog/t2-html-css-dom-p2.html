      <li>What is a grid design?</li>

      <p>It's a structure used to align the elements into the grids. It makes you have a layout clean and well organised.</p>

      <li>What is all the hype about responsive web page?</li>

      <p>We use lots of different screen sizes and a web page have to correspond to these screens on different sizes, Then having a responsive web page is important to people access it in whatever device screen size they want and it will work just fine.</p>

      <li>What is semantic structure?</li>

      <p>Semantic structure is organising your code writing using the right tags on the right code writing.</p>

      <li>Points that I found interesting and want to reflect on?</li>

      <p>Well, is everything new for me, so I find everything interesting and I feel curious to get more knowledge in everything possible. But I really liked to knew about the grid design, it looks so good to working on and I love make things organised.
        I'm excited to learn how to do it ASAP!</p>
