    <p>I tried to do maditation a few times but it never worked for me, because I have trouble to focus and I'm not patient enough for it... yet!</p>
    <p>I need manage my time for study I'm not very good at it, but I'm doing rules for myself and I'm getting it, this week was an achievement for me.</p>
    <p>The Pomodoro technique sounds really cool, I think for who wants to start manage their time, this is a good one. I'm already doing it and it is great having a break for a coffee or an icream as I'm doing at home - I love cone icecream - and it works
      well.
    </p>
    <p>When I get used to the Pomodoro technique I'll try to meditate for 5 minutes on the break time.
