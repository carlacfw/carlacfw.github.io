        <p> In this chapter they are talking about self awareness, <em>Self-awareness … is a neutral mode that maintains self-reflectiveness even in the midst of
turbulent emotions.</em> <b>—Daniel Goleman</b>. And also, comparing it with mindfulness, which we saw in the previous chapter. If we analise both analogy, they are essentially the same thing.
          <em>Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment,
and non-judgmentally.</em> <b>—Jon Kabat-Zinn</b>. Both practice can be trained, this means that we can develop it by ourselves, we just need to pain atention and being able to analise our attitudes.</p>
        <p>There are two formal practices, to develop self-awareness and both are based on mindfulness. Body Scan and Journaling. This two practices help developing self-knowledge and self-honesty, also create the conditions for self-confidence.</p>
        <p>Body Scan means, stop for a few minutes and analise what your body is telling you, part by part, it is very relaxing, you can try it at night, because it will help you to sleep, if you are having trouble to sleep as I sometimes have, it works!</p>
        <p>Emotions are not me... This is trick, is easy to say "I am angry" or "I am hungry" and understand that this is just an emotion, a moment feeling, it is not who you are, is just what you are feeling, ok. But what about happiness? I consider myself,
          as a happy person, but happiness is just a feeling rigth? It is not who you are. Then what am I? I think I need more mindfulness practice, to understand it.</p>
