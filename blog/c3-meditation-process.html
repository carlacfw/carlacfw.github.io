      <li>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</li>

      <p>It is funny how the description about "process over product" is so realist. I've struggled I've comparede myself with others and I felt frustrated in some moments. But it was because I was making something totally new, so I think it is normal and
        I know my limits, I know what I'm capable of at this point and I know that I don't need make something perfect, I have to make it works and look beautiful and I did it, so yes I'm pretty happy with what I've done and with all my improvment.</p>
