  <div class="content">
    <p>You have two ears to listen to and only one mouth to speak. Which means that we need to listen more than speaking, and <em>"Maidful Conversation"</em> is about it. Sometimes is hard to focus in a conversation for any reasons, but if you are participating
      in a conversation is right you listen what the other people is saying is a port of being polite. Listening, looping and dipping they really are skills that we should be good at. When we give the gift of attention to the speaker we are open to listen,
      to make sure that we are undertanding what the speaker is saying we use the loop communication, which is kinda confirming to the speaker if what you understood is what they meant to say, showing that you really listen to them. The last one, dipping,
      is checking with myself how I am feeling about what I just heard and then I belive that we can give the speaker some reaction and/or some feedback.</P>
    <p>I having English as a second language and not being fluent at all, I need this because sometimes a simple misunderstand can change the whole idea about what really is saying, so definetely looping is a good one to me to improve.</p>
