        <h4>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h4>
        <p>Self control is something that or I have or I don't, there is no middle term. I usually have, but, while programming when I get frustrated because I can't find any solution for some problem, even tried many different ways, neither google have
          helped me, this is a trigger.</p>
        <p>Then I feel my heart beating very fast and I feel like very sad and irritated. Sometimes I don't have the knowlwdge necessary for something which "I know" that is ok because I'm still learning, but it's hard to accept it and I feel bad for not
          being able to do something by myself and I have to aks for help.</p>
        <h4>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h4>
        <p>It is nice and if you really try, it works. It's incredible how our body correspond to our mind.</p>
