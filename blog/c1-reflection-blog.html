    <p>In my personal opinion, EDA has a very helpful enviroment, you can see lots of people with the same professional interest as you and at the same time is a totaly relexed place, where people are friendly, you can have a chat with anyone, you can get
      to know people whose you just met, you can always ask for help and there will be someone ready to help you or at least try to undestand what are you struggling with.<br> You can share your opinion and ideas and one important thing I have been learn
      in these few days is, everybody here wants to learn, but it is not just coding, the idea is learning whatever positive thing you can, for example, I have learned that I have to be pacient with myself and do not freak out if I'm feeling completely
      lost, because I know I can do it.</P>
    <p>Having a cohort is really good, there is people with the same goal as you, same expetation and ready to help each other. It makes you feel confident. Do not metter how much knowledge you have because you can do it if you really want it, we can't doubt
      of ourselves it is incredible what we can learn in 1 day, but for it you have to want it and try hard.</p>
    <p>I consider myself as a easy adaptable person. At the moment I become part of a new enviroment, I don't have difficult to engage it.<br> However I also consider myself a bit shy, but I enjoy meet new people and don't feel it as a difficulty. I just
      don't feel confortable enough to start a conversation with someone I don't know, but after that everything goes easy.<br> I feel really glad when I'm able to help someone and I don't hesitate to ask for help when I need it.</p>
    <p>I confess I was holping for more support from EDA. As a beginner in web development, I'm not familiar with none of the tools we use in the course.<br> When I had the first task about clone a repo from GitHub using the command line, I had no idea from
      where to start, there wasn't nothing specific explain how to do it and I felt very frustated.<br> My personal opinion is, EDA could be better prepared for beginners or could require knowledge about specific tools. Or maybe this is the idea, you
      have to be self-taught, I really don't know.<br> I had external help, so I could understand how command line works and how to use it, but I was expecting it from EDA.</p>
    <p>I'm still very exited about the course, I've already learned things that I've never tought I'd be able of and it makes me feel even more exited. I think the first step, which is to be familiar with the tools is the hardest part, but after that I'm
      sure it will be fine.<br> Having gratuated students around in the campus is very good, they makes you feel confident and exited because you will be the next graduated.</p>
    <p>Sometimes you can feel nervous because you don't know what is coming next, is all new. But then you have to take a breath and only focus on what you are doing now, stop worry about the next!<br> The most important thing to keep doing it, is not doubt
      of yourself and keep your mind open, to learn even on the hard times.</p>
    <p> There was a phrase on the video that I found very interesting, it is <em><b>"If you wanna go fast, go alone. If you wanna go far, go together"</b></em> it reminds us that we are working in a team and we should joying it.
